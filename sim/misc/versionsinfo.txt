#This file presents a summary of the additions and changes
#in every version of sim42

v1.1.6.0
Command Line Interface:
- Display StdLiqVolflow as default
- Added about command in cli to display version. 
"about $" displays the version of the thermo provider.
"about " displays the version of the active object.
"about /" displays the version of sim42.
- Changes to the export command to facilitate adding custom code to export sim42 cases into custom formats.


Unit Operations:
- Added HydrateThermoBased where the ThermoProvider is responsible of the hydrate formation calculation.
   Also includes a HydrateCurve unit operation.
- Added profiels to heaters and coolers.
- Fixes in multisided exchanger to make it faster. It can now track phase changes when in blance mode (no ua specified)
- Re-coded PipeSegment completely. Itnow inlcudes differnt options for PressureDrop calculations and also uses a Plug-In model concept
   where more pressure drop correlations can be added by users given that they comply to a specific interface.
   The pressure models include, Laminar, Colebrook, Churchill for one phase and LockartMartinelli for two phases
   A number of profiles are also provided including properties, velocity, Re.
- Tower:
   Added PumpAround specs such as Return T, DeltaT, and return properties
   Added degrees of subcooling
   Now the tower can start from 'LastConvergedSolution' even if the last attempt unconverged the tower.
   Added 'TriggerSolve' parameter which can be set to 1 and solves the tower only once flipping TriggerSolve back to 0.
   Pass messages while calculating long jacobians, so the tower doesn't look dead while calculating them.
   Added a pressure profile object which allows for easier specification of pressures for stages with no objects.
   Added PropertySpecWithSettings which only implements for now CutTemperature specs.
- Special properties now notify users of messages/warnings passed by the thermo provider when calculating the properties.


Simba:
- Can specify P profiles in towers directly
- Degrees of subcooling (towers)
- Profiles and plots in heat exchangers
- Added Hydrate unit op and Hydrate curve unit op with specific forms
- PipeSegment form
- Heater/Cooler form
- Pump Around specs in tower
- Allow for displaying volume fractions everywhere




v1.1.5.0
- Added FlowFraction0 ... FlowFractionN, for specifying the flow from a splitter as a fractio of the feed flow.
- Added >> for copying the specs from a port into another port.
- Added the maxversions commands in order to keep maxversions backups of a simulation, where maxversions can be any integer value.
- A bunch of enhancements to the Tower focused on converging difficult TEG absorbers.
- Check for the reactor stoichiometry not to yieald an unbalance
- Efficiencies in tower for specific compounds


simba:
- Tower summary now displays internal connections and breaks the summary for each section (side stripper).
- Bug fix when selecting compounds with  more than one space in their name.




v1.1.4.1
- Fixed a nasty units problem when running reactors and having vmgsim installed froma previous version
- Support for changing names of feed and draws (including pump arounds)
- support for special properties as specs in the tower
- support for volume and std volume specs in the tower
- commonproperties can be set without having to specify a property package


Simba:
- Added links at the top of the tower form in simba to quickly move to its different sections
- Simba now displays the version of sim42 that it runs
- Added a special form for special properties and boiling point curves
- Added shortcuts to add special properties as specs
- Shortcuts to change names and stages of feeds and draws



v1.1.4.0
A bunch of bug fixes such as:
- Problems converging columns near azeotropes,
- Occassional errors when calculating StdLiqMolarVol
- Added PFR
- Got rid of error message that woud pop up when storing cases
- Fixed a ton of memory leaks,  fund when running sim42 for hours coupled to
  an optimizer and a DCS from a distiallation column from a lab
- Fixes to import different s42 files into one same case.


Simba:
- Preferences option in the File menu. Can be used to view molar fractions,
  mole flows, right beow material ports; To default a language ana bunch of
  other things.
- Bug fixes for displaying some preferences.
- A few extra filters when selecting compounds besided the default "Gas
  Processing"
- Prop pkgs can be selected with and advnaced option to assign different
  packages to different phases
- Prop pkgs can be changed within the same thermo case (results are not lost)



v1.1.3.0
- Added Kinetic Reactor with support for complex rate expressions

- Added support for oil charachterization 

- Added design objects support. Used for sizing of unit operations

- Added 5 different options of design objects for 3PhaseSep and 3 options for 2PhaseSep

- Added support for a solid phase. The separator updates the ports accordingly. To set it in the CLI...
SolidPhases = 1 #Default 0

- Added a Properties.SpecialProps() unit op. It can be used to display properties such as, pH, PNA, BubblePoint,
WaterDewPoint, RVPD323, etc
