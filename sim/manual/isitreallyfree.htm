<p class=heading-3>Is it really free?</p>
<p class=heading-3-p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=body-text>The simulator code has been <A 
href="license.html">licensed</A> using a <A href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"><span class=hyperlink>BSD style open source license</span></a>. This permits the free distribution and modification of all source code and unlike <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php"><span class=hyperlink>GPL style licenses</span></a> does not require redistribution of modifications. We felt this was important as cases may arise where companies wish to modify the simulator for use with proprietary models. We still hope most improvements will be shared with the community. </p>
<p class=body-text>At this time there is no open source thermo package available for the simulator. <a href="http://www.virtualmaterials.com"><span class=hyperlink>Virtual Materials Group</span></a> is very supportive of this project and have made copies of their commercial property package system available for the initial development of the simulator. This package can also be downloaded and used by anyone, but unlicensed copies are restricted to the use of the RK (Redlich-Kwong) and ideal solution property packages. VMG personnel have also contributed a number of unit operations and other code to the open source repository. </p>
<p class=body-text>Writing a high quality property package is no small undertaking, but as the thermo interface to the simulator is clearly defined, we expect that a number of property package systems, both proprietary and open source, will eventually be interfaced to the simulator. The design of the simulator even allows multiple thermo providers to be used in the same flow sheet and in some cases, such as different sides of a heat exchanger, even within one unit operation. </p>
